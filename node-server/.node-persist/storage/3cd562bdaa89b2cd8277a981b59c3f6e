{"key":"YkmYV","value":{"commonName":"Sunƒçanica","latinName":"Macrolepiota procera","description":"The height and cap diameter of a mature specimen may both reach 40 cm, a size truly impressive for the fruiting body of an agaric. The stipe is relatively thin and reaches full height before the cap has expanded. The stipe is very fibrous in texture which renders it inedible. The surface is characteristically wrapped in a snakeskin-like pattern of scaly growths (therefore, known in some parts of Europe as the \"snake's hat\" or \"snake's sponge\"). The immature cap is compact and egg-shaped, with the cap margin around the stipe, sealing a chamber inside the cap. As it matures, the margin breaks off, leaving a fleshy, movable ring around the stipe.","edibility":"Edible","image":"http://pvinformer.me/images/artikli/640_30209420_c987a1b31fd3f1f08322280ca0954f48_XL.jpg","id":"YkmYV"}}
