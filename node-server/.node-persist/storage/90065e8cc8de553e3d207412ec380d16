{"key":"gIABw","value":{"commonName":"Biserka","latinName":"Amanita rubescens","description":"The European blusher has a reddish-brown convex pileus (cap), that is up to 15 cm across, and strewn with small cream-coloured warts. It is sometimes covered with an ochre-yellow flush which can be washed by the rain. The flesh of the mushroom is white, becoming pink when bruised or exposed to air. This is a key feature in differentiating it from the poisonous false blusher or panther cap (Amanita pantherina), whose flesh does not. The stipe (stem) is white with flushes of the cap colour, and grows to a height of up to 15 cm. The gills are white and free of the stem, and display red spots when damaged.","edibility":"Edible","image":"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/6859e9d2-365b-4e3e-84c9-2b78b807e3cc/dbie1o2-8ffa4eed-2524-408a-8ce7-bb51a4ccd9fc.jpg/v1/fill/w_1024,h_769,q_75,strp/amanita_rubescens_by_oniroid_dbie1o2-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NzY5IiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvNjg1OWU5ZDItMzY1Yi00ZTNlLTg0YzktMmI3OGI4MDdlM2NjXC9kYmllMW8yLThmZmE0ZWVkLTI1MjQtNDA4YS04Y2U3LWJiNTFhNGNjZDlmYy5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MTAyNCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.X9oOadxvOjcuP-OacMUmzkO3GloTTIK8C2ejDvRXsO0","id":"gIABw"}}
