It has been responsible for many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe. E. sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.","edibility":"Poisonous","image":"http://gribi.net.ua/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Entoloma-sinuatum1.jpg","id":"eTnGV"}}
